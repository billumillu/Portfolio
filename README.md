# [Image Segmentation | fastai Unet](https://github.com/billumillu/Image-Segmentation-fastai-Unet)
This implementation uses fastai's UNet model, where the CNN backbone (e.g. ResNet) is pre-trained on ImageNet and hence can be fine-tuned with only small amounts of annotated training examples.
## Data
In this notebook, we use a toy dataset specified in DATA_PATH which consists of 129 images of 4 classes of beverage containers {can, carton, milk bottle, water bottle}. For each image, a pixel-wise ground-truth mask is provided for training and evaluation.
